# Dining
At work, we were creating monthly calendars for when to call down people for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner by hand.

After seeing how much time was needed to do this, I decided to make a program that would make it easier to fill in the calendars.
Later, I planned to add a GUI so that it could just be printed out.

For fairness, ideally no group would be at the same spot on the list from one day to the next.
Nor would one group be first from one day to the next.

At first, it seemed logical to just randomly assign the groups each day in a week; however, the project proved that randomness was not what was needed.
